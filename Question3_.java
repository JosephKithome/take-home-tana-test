//    Question 3
//    You are given an array of n integer numbers a[0], a[1], ..., a[n - 1]. Find the distance between the two closest (nearest) minimums in it. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.
//    Example: Given the following array [1,2,3,1,4,5,2] The function should return 3 Explanation: 1 is the smallest (minimum) number which appears twice. a[0] = 1 a[3] = 1 The distance is 3-0 = 3
